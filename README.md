# IoT Light using NodeMCU and Flutter
Control the LED of your NodeMCU ESP8266 using an app made by you using Flutter

## Running the code

Arduino IDE: Run the ino file code in the Arduino IDE and wait for the IP address to appear on the Serial Monitor. 
Search for the IP address on your browser to get the simple HTML page for controlling your NodeMCU LED or use Flutter to make your own app to do the same.

## Flutter

Android Studio: Change the pubspec.yaml with the one I have provided. Change the entire main.dart file with the code that I have provided. Change the IP address with the one that had appeared on the Serial Monitor of your Arduino IDE.

Run it on your emulator or actual device with the NodeMCU being uploaded with the code and keep the NodeMCU connected to the computer all throughout the process.

That's all, you are done!!!!
